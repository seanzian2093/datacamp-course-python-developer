# Use `zip` to combine two lists and iterate over them or unpack it to a list

# Use `Counter` from `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in a list

# Use `set` operation to compare differences between two lists

# Use `set` operations to aseess membership of elements in a or more lists is faster than using a list

# Use `set` to find unique elements in a list is fast

# Use `ndarray` to do sum or mean of elements in a list for better porformance

# Use list comprehension to loop faster than using a for loop
