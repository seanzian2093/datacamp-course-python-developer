# Install `pip install line_profiler` and `pip install memory_profiler`
# Install `pip install IPython` to use IPython shell

# In IPython shell, use
# `%load_ext line_profiler` and `%load_ext memory_profiler` to load the extensions
# `%lprun -f function_name function_name(args)` to profile line by line
# `%mprun -f function_name function_name(args)` to profile memory usage line by line


# Conclusion:
# use numpy broadcasting to perform element-wise operations on arrays
